## Brief

#### MyHome.ie Technical Test - Back End Software Developer

Build a RESTful Web API that serves the attached list of properties from a database. This should allow adding, editing, deleting and getting the property as required.
Please also provide:

1. Unit tests as part of this API showing a TDD approach.
2. A swagger or some kind of documentation for the API.

We are looking for code that is simple, well architected, maintainable, testable, and sticks to the brief.

Create a GIT repository for your project and send a link once complete.
